## Supercollaboration in software engineering education

2011 - present

Programming is inherently collaborative. Even when we are working alone at our desks, we are working with code produced by other programmers, and we are writing code that will be modified and built upon by other programmers. Many of the activities that we engage in as engineers -- version control, continuous integration, test-driven development, API design, ticket management, etc -- are focused on the collaborative nature of programming.  These collaborations are extended over time, and with an open-ended set of participants (your program needs to be modifiable by future engineers your company hasn't hired yet).

We've developed a unique teaching course that centres on "supercollaborative" projects, in which many teams of students work on the same code base. This means that the size of the project can be very large -- in 2013, we had 170 students working on a shared code-base.
