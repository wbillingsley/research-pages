title: Dynamic courses from ecosystems of content

## Socially evolving courses

circa 2005 - 2008.  Revived 2011

We had a vision to make courses that are social and connectivist, and that promote dynamic sharing of content between courses.

If you've ever taken a teaching course, it has probably involved a fairly fixed sequence of lectures or videos, mostly produced by the lecturer. And it has probably covered topics for which there are some fabulous materials out there on the web, outside the course, and new ones being created all the time.

I wrote a learning environment in which courses could evolve socially. Students, tutors, and others could add content and examples, and the students' interactions with the materials would give data on which materials were and weren't useful, and why. Content was tagged with a topic and a type, and we made adding and writing new content for a topic easy. Students could jump from the lecture notes on Kirchoff's Current Law, to someone else's video, to a smart exercise, very easily.  

Originally, this was part of the "Intelligent Book" project, focusing on online textbooks. It hosted the smart interactive exercises for discrete mathematics.

In 2011, though, Jorn Guy Su√ü and I were asked to redesign a course at the University of Queensland, and we were able to experiment with what this might mean in-class for a course rather than just a textbook.  I wrote a new version of the software that had much more live interactivity -- as we'd interact "online" with the students in the lecture theatre as well as outside.
