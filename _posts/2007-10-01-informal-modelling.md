## Informal modelling

2007

Very often, the questions we want to ask students are informal. Many questions are in English, rather than a symbolic notation. And often we're pedagogically more interested in the broad thrust of the student's argument and reasoning, rather than the low-level algebra of any equations. Even on a discrete mathematics course, we found more informal questions than formal questions. 

To support these kinds of wordy questions, we need ways of modelling and checking the correctness of the argument without the detail. Some of this is simply about pedagogical trickery -- the realisation that while we want the student to work out the answer for themselves, we can give the AI marking it some unfair advantages. As an example, I wrote a "Wednesday afternoon prover" that could mark wordy proofs in number theory, just using simple predicate logic.

The questions were much faster to write, and could assess more of the questions we wanted to ask.
