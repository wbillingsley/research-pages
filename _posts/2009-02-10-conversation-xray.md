## Automatic visualised analysis of conversations

2009 - 2010

It's one thing to say that in a conversation, at 2:37 the topic of the conversation is cancer. It's another to say that at 2:37, the topic of the conversation is cancer, there's a dirty great silence, the patient is shuffling in their chair, the doctor has been talking about drug dosages, the patient has been talking about pain, suffering, and death, and the topics have not overlapped.

We developed a system that could take a video and its transcript, and would put the conversation through many different kinds of pluggable analysis: topic mapping, relevance mapping, prosody, movement, and others. The analyses were then visualised together, so that a viewer could explore what happened across the conversation before you watch the video.

It was developed for communication skills training for medical students. Medical training typically includes "standard patient exercises", where the student is asked to have a consultation with an actor who is playing a patient. These are typically videorecorded and examined after-the-fact, so augmenting the recording with automated visual analytics is a natural step forward.

The project was led by a health service executive with a part-time appointment at NICTA, which led to two unusual requirements (for a computer science project):
 
* We were asked not to run any experiments, or publish major papers in computer science venues. 

* We were also asked not to invent any new algorithms. 

The rationale for these was that only clinical experiments published in clinical venues would have impact on the health service. (We did get away with publishing some "work in progress" papers to computer science venues.)
