## Searching questions

circa 2007 - 2008. Revisited 2013 - 

*Searching Questions* (or "massively multiple choice questions") solve the problem of how to ask and assess short answer questions on the web.

If you ask a mutliple choice question, you have to show the answer to the student, and they might recognise it or use a process of elimination, rather than working it out for themselves. If you ask a short answer question, they have to come up with the answer themselves, but it's hard to automatically assess the answer. Even if you apply very clever natural language processing, the student will probably still worry "What if the machine misunderstands my answer?".

Searching questions solve this dilemma with a search-and-select process. Behind the scenes there's any number of pre-written and pre-marked answers. It could be just a few, it could be hundreds. But they're not shown to the student initially. Instead the student is asked to  search for them.  

The query does a few things for us. 

* It means we only show answers that the student probably already thought of (some very simple tweaks to the indexing and processing for each question can help ensure this). 
* It means we can keep as many answers as we like (eg, a question with 300 answers). 
* It removes any ambiguity in the natural language processing -- the student confirms what they meant by picking an answer.
* It gives the student a formative experience. First, thinking about the question to come up with a query. Then reading and reviewing potential answers. Then deciding if there's a good answer, or if they need to revise their query.

I've started to revisit this in 2013, as the rise of massively open online courses means there's a growing need for this.
